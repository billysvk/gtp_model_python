Hi guys, I might be wrong, but on my opinion, fine-tuning is aimed to improve model results quality and not to train it to answer based on factual data.

What would work is:

Create a document with facts
embed the facts to get vectors (store vectors on your end)
when a bot recieves a question about facts, embed the question to get itâ€™s vector, then using cosine similarity algorithm, find the facts that are close by vectors and give those facts as context to the prompt to the bot to use those facts to answer the question.
There is a guide on using embeddings for question answering in the docs.
